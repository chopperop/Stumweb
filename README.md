Stumweb: the front page of New York City!

Stumweb is a user submitted news feed of NYC, but you don't have to follow or be friends with anyone. Ever wonder what is going on in New York City at the moment? Start posting breaking updates, photos, reviews, upcoming events, etc. about NYC so other New Yorkers can see it! 

This app is written in ruby and uses Ruby on Rails, Twitter Bootstrap, Carrierwave plus MiniMagick, Amazon S3, Sendgrid using RoR ActionMailer, and hosted on Heroku.

This is my first project and I know the code is messy. I written a summary of the best features of my app and the code behind them. You can find the summary at www.stumweb.com/bestfeatures
